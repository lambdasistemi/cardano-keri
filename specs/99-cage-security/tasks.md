  dispatching implementation slices.

## Slice 1 — Full-transaction test harness

Owned files:

- `onchain/validators/cage_context.ak` (new — full-context constructors)
- `onchain/validators/cage.tests.ak`

Tasks:

- [X] T099-S1 Add reusable `Transaction`/`Input`/`Output`/`OutputReference`/
  `Value`/datum constructors built on `transaction.placeholder`.
- [X] T099-S1 Add full-tx happy-path fixtures + accept tests for Mint, Migrate,
  Modify, End that pass on current code (regression baseline).
- [X] T099-S1 No `mpfCage` behavior change in this slice.
- [X] T099-S1 Run the focused command and `./gate.sh`.
- [X] T099-S1 Commit as `test(onchain): add full-transaction cage test harness`.

Focused command:

```sh
cd onchain && nix shell nixpkgs#aiken --command aiken check
```

## Slice 2 — Harden Minting confinement (FR1 / H3-mint)

Owned files:

- `onchain/validators/cage.ak`
- `onchain/validators/cage.tests.ak`

Tasks:

- [X] T099-S2 RED (a): full-tx attack test — mint accepted with the thread
  token absent from / outside the designated state output.
- [X] T099-S2 RED (b): full-tx attack test — mint accepted with an additional
  asset name (or extra quantity) under the cage policy.
- [X] T099-S2 GREEN: require exactly one cage-policy asset at quantity 1
  (derived from the consumed output reference) present in the state output at
  the cage script; reject any extra asset name/quantity under the policy.
- [X] T099-S2 Keep the happy-path Mint accept test green.
- [X] T099-S2 Run the focused command and `./gate.sh`.
- [X] T099-S2 Commit as `fix(onchain): confine minted cage token to the state output`.

Focused command:

```sh
cd onchain && nix shell nixpkgs#aiken --command aiken check
```

## Slice 3 — Harden Burn/End lifecycle (FR2 / H1+H6)

Owned files:

- `onchain/validators/cage.ak`
- `onchain/validators/types.ak` (`Burning` gains a `TokenId`)
- `onchain/validators/cage.tests.ak`

Tasks:

- [X] T099-S3 RED (a): full-tx attack — positive mint accepted under `Burning`
  (otherwise-valid owner-authorized End; only defect is `+q`).
- [X] T099-S3 RED (b): full-tx attack — burn accepted with a mismatched /
  absent matching cage-state End spend (coupling defect, not merely absent
  signer).
- [X] T099-S3 RED (c): full-tx attack — burn accepted without the owner
  signature on the matching End spend.
- [X] T099-S3 RED (d): full-tx attack — mismatched / extra cage-policy mint
  entry accepted alongside the `-1`.
- [X] T099-S3 RED (e): full-tx attack — owner-signed `Burning(TokenId)` +
  `Modify([])` token-dropping burn accepted (burn via a non-`End` state spend;
  H6 reverse guard). Record observed counts RED→GREEN.
- [X] T099-S3 GREEN: `Burning` rejects every positive cage-policy quantity and
  accepts only exactly one cage-policy mint entry (the matching thread token at
  `-1`) coupled to the owner-authorized `End` spend; AND a `validModify`
  **reverse guard** — `Modify` may not mint or burn its own thread token — so an
  exact burn can coexist only with the owner-authorized `End` branch (one exact
  lifecycle transition; H6 exclusivity).
- [X] T099-S3 This reverse guard is **distinct from FR4**: it does NOT require
  the token in the continuing output. FR4/H3-modify output confinement (blocking
  a no-burn `Modify` from moving the token out) is a separate Slice-5 target,
  additive to this guard; S5 must preserve this S3 check, not revert it.
- [X] T099-S3 Keep the happy-path End + Modify accept tests green; keep Slice-2
  `validateMint` green.
- [X] T099-S3 `Burning(TokenId)` wire change is Aiken-only (no Haskell mirror);
  record the reasoning in `WIP.md`.
- [X] T099-S3 Run the focused command and `./gate.sh`.
- [X] T099-S3 Commit as `fix(onchain): couple cage burn to owner-authorized end`;
  commit body states the reverse guard (`validModify` refuses to mint/burn its
  own thread token) completing exact Burn↔End coupling.

Focused command:

```sh
cd onchain && nix shell nixpkgs#aiken --command aiken check
```

## Slice 4 — Harden Migrating pin + confinement (FR3 / H2+H3-migration)

Owned files:

- `onchain/validators/cage.ak`
- `onchain/validators/types.ak`
- `onchain/validators/cage.tests.ak`

Tasks:

- [X] T099-S4 RED (a): full-tx attack test — migration accepted from an
  attacker-created predecessor policy.
- [X] T099-S4 RED (b): full-tx attack test — extra or non-exact
  predecessor/successor policy quantity or asset name accepted.
- [X] T099-S4 GREEN: pin the predecessor policy/version (validator parameter or
  genuine-predecessor-spend at pinned version-1); exactly 1 predecessor burn /
  1 successor mint, rejecting extra entries under either policy; confine the
  successor token in the state output.
- [X] T099-S4 Keep the happy-path Migrate accept test green.
- [X] T099-S4 If the pinning mechanism cannot reject an attacker predecessor
  within AC3, BLOCK to the epic owner (do not weaken acceptance).
- [X] T099-S4 Run the focused command and `./gate.sh`.
- [X] T099-S4 Commit as `fix(onchain): pin cage migration predecessor and confine successor`.

Focused command:

```sh
cd onchain && nix shell nixpkgs#aiken --command aiken check
```

## Slice 5 — Harden Modify confinement + authorization (FR4+FR5+FR6 / H3-modify+H4+H5)

FR4/H3-modify output confinement is a **genuine S5 RED→GREEN** target (distinct
from the S3 reverse guard). S5 must keep the S3 `validModify` no-mint/burn guard
intact (additive — not weaken/revert).

Owned files:

- `onchain/validators/cage.ak`
- `onchain/validators/types.ak` (only if a mirrored type's wire shape changes)
- `onchain/validators/cage.tests.ak`
- `offchain/lib/Cardano/KERI/AID/Cage/Types.hs` (only on a mirrored wire change)
- `offchain/test/Cardano/KERI/AID/Cage/TypesSpec.hs` (only on a mirrored wire change)
- `offchain/app/GenVectors.hs` (only if the auth message shape changes)

Tasks:

- [X] T099-S5 RED (a): a no-burn `Modify` moving the thread token OUT of the
  continuing state output accepted (FR4/H3-modify — the S3 reverse guard only
  blocks minting/burning the token, so this move-out is still open).
- [X] T099-S5 RED (b): output-`identity_root` self-authorization accepted (auth
  proven against the tx's own output root).
- [X] T099-S5 RED (c): an unrelated authenticated AID authorizes the key.
- [X] T099-S5 RED (d): a raw-`owner_aid` prefix (the AID bytes, not their
  `blake2b_256`) authorizes the key.
- [X] T099-S5 GREEN: require the exact thread token in the continuing state
  output (FR4); authenticate against the input/reference identity root (FR5);
  require `bytearray.length(requestKey) >= 32` and
  `bytearray.take(requestKey, 32) == blake2b_256(owner_aid)` (FR6); keep the S3
  no-mint/burn guard intact.
- [X] T099-S5 Keep the happy-path Modify accept test green.
- [X] T099-S5 If a mirrored type wire shape changes, update the Haskell mirror +
  `TypesSpec.hs` (+ regen vectors) in this same commit; else keep existing
  golden green and note "no cross-layer change" in `WIP.md`.
- [X] T099-S5 Run the focused commands and `./gate.sh`.
- [X] T099-S5 Commit as `fix(onchain): authenticate cage modify against input identity state`.

Focused commands:

```sh
cd onchain && nix shell nixpkgs#aiken --command aiken check
just unit "Cage"   # only if the offchain parity files changed
```

## Slice 6 — Execution-unit measurements + supported bound (FR9)

Owned files:

- `onchain/validators/cage_measurements.ak` (new)
- `specs/99-cage-security/REPORT.md` (new)

Tasks:

- [X] T099-S6 Add full-context `const` measurement fixtures invoking the
  hardened handlers on their accept path (Mint, Migrate, Modify at the supported
  batch size, End).
- [X] T099-S6 Run `aiken check --plain-numbers` and record memory/CPU per path.
- [X] T099-S6 Compare each to the mainnet per-tx budget (mem 14,000,000; CPU
  10,000,000,000); state the supported Modify batch/output bound.
- [X] T099-S6 Write `REPORT.md` with the fit verdict and the supported bound.
- [X] T099-S6 Run `./gate.sh`.
- [X] T099-S6 Commit as `docs(onchain): measure hardened cage execution units`.

Focused command:

```sh
cd onchain && nix shell nixpkgs#aiken --command aiken check --plain-numbers
```

## Slice 7 — Prototype implementation-status text (FR10)

Owned files:

- `docs/index.md`

Tasks:

- [X] T099-S7 Keep the system labelled a prototype; describe #99 as one
  completed security gate among the work still required. Do NOT frame #99 as the
  sole remaining reason for prototype status, and do NOT claim production
  readiness; closing #99 does not lift the prototype label.
- [X] T099-S7 Run `./gate.sh`.
- [X] T099-S7 Commit as `docs: record cage security gate; keep prototype label`.

Focused command:

```sh
./gate.sh
```

## Slice 8 — Live-boundary measurement follow-up (FR9/AC9 boundary proof)

Owned files:

- `specs/99-cage-security/REPORT.md`
- `onchain/validators/cage_boundary.ak` (new — only if the UPLC-eval smoke is added)

Tasks:

- [ ] T099-S8 Amend `REPORT.md`: distinguish "measured handler ceiling = 65"
  (source-level typed fixtures, empty single-leaf MPF proofs, ledger `Data`
  deserialization excluded) from a production-supported bound; remove guidance
  treating 65 as a safe on-chain cap.
- [ ] T099-S8 Attempt an in-PR live-boundary smoke: `aiken build`/`aiken export`
  the Modify spend handler to UPLC with `Data`-encoded datum/redeemer/context
  applied, then `aiken uplc eval` (real mem/cpu incl. `Data` deserialization) at
  a **declared** representative/maximum MPF proof depth; record the
  boundary-inclusive number. Extend `gate.sh` with it only if it runs
  deterministically.
- [ ] T099-S8 If the UPLC-eval smoke is infeasible in-scope, report the exact
  missing evaluator step (do not fake it).
- [ ] T099-S8 Full node phase-2 boundary is out of local scope (no host
  `cardano-cli`/`node`/`uplc`; no #99 tx builder in repo). If neither smoke can
  be exercised safely in-scope, the orchestrator writes a parent Q-file naming
  the missing offchain #99 tx builder + `yaci-devkit` evaluation, a named
  operator artifact required before the PR leaves draft, and a conservative
  recommendation; AC9 is carried as that named follow-up, NOT claimed satisfied.
- [ ] T099-S8 Do NOT alter the S6 commit `bc8d9b2` in place; fresh commit(s),
  pair-reviewed.
- [ ] T099-S8 Run `./gate.sh`.
- [ ] T099-S8 Commit as `docs(onchain): distinguish measured cage ceiling from production bound`.

Focused command:

```sh
cd onchain && nix shell nixpkgs#aiken --command aiken check
```

## Finalization

- [ ] T099-F1 Update PR #100 body with delivered behavior, execution units,
  supported bound, attack paths proven RED→GREEN, and verification evidence.
- [ ] T099-F2 Rerun `./gate.sh` and `just ci` at HEAD and record results.
- [ ] T099-F3 Run the finalization audit for PR #100 and
  `specs/99-cage-security/tasks.md`.
- [ ] T099-F4 Drop `gate.sh` in `chore: drop gate.sh (ready for review)`.
- [ ] T099-F5 Mark the PR ready only after local gate and CI are green; leave
  merge to the epic owner.
